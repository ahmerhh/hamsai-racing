# HAMSAI

This is the current logic in use by HanstersAI/$HAMSAI to be sure to provide a level of verifiably fair gameplay. 

Eventually, we hope to implement AI agents to represent each Hamster, which will allow for each individual Hamster to utilize different tactics and strategies - ultimately leading to a different outcome each time. In this case, racing lines would be adjusted to winnings vs current where racing lines will remain stagnant, as there are no  forces influencing the race besides chance. 

This can similarly be applied to a number of different mini-games.
